## Introduction
This repository contains my submission for the Tasks assessment for Machine Learning and Statistics in 2020.

The repository contains the following:

1. A [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/pcaulfie/sqrt2/blob/main/Tasks2020.ipynb) to detail my work.
1. Gitignore file
1. Images folder containing some images used in the readme and jupyter notebook.
1. Excel file called "Square Root without Calculator" where I first mapped out the Babylonian square-root algorithm using an example from math.com.
1. Licence
1. Readme

## Summary
The assessment consistes of four separate tasks, which are detailed in my jupyter notebook. The jupyter notebook contains 4 sections, each section details one of the four tasks which make up the assessment. Below is a brief outline of each of the tasks:

* Task 1: The objective of this task is to write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. The function should not depend on any module from the standard python library or other external library.

* Task 2: Using scipy.stats package, I verify the value of the Chi-squared Test published in a Wikipedia article and determine whether the the two categorical variables are independent. The Wikipedia article gives the table below as an example [1], stating the Chi-squared value based on it is approximately 24.6 .

* Task 3: The purpose of this task is to research excel standard deviation functions and explain which function gives a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample.

* Task 4: Using scikit-learn, I apply k-means clustering to Fisher’s famous Iris data set. I explain how my code works and discuss it's accuracy. I go on to outline how my model could be used to make predictions of species of iris.

## Installation

- I recommend that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution of python which contains all the libraries used, as well as an instance of Jupyter notebook.

### How to Clone This Repository

1. Launch Cmder
1. Usine cmder prompt, create a folder where you want to clone the repository - for example *cd folder/to/clone-into/*
1. Specify URL of the repository you want to clone using the following command: 
 * *git clone https://github.com/pcaulfie/sqrt2.git*
 * This will download the project to a folder named after the Git repository ("sqrt2" in this case). 
 * If you want a different folder name, simply specify it as the last parameter: *git clone https://github.com/pcaulfie/sqrt2.git other-name*

### How to Run the Jupyter Notebook
1. Go to folder where you cloned the repository e.g. *folder/to/clone-into/*
1. Enter the following command at the cmder prompt: *jupyter notebook*
 * This will open the jupyter notebook in your browser.
 * Alternatively, copy and paste a URL which will be shown in cmder it will look like this: http://localhost:8888/?token=e0dd2199f102d064481eb587953e5d77adadf4fc3a7a29
